<p>This has been a very fun class I have learned more than I could have ever imagined to learn in a month. This project was challenging but very fun. Unfortunately because of my teeth and the visits to the dentist that I had I am unable to complete all 12 functions instead I decided to focus more on the 6 to try getting a better grade on those. I believe that this project just shows how much that we actually learned in this class.</p>
